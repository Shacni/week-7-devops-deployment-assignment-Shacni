# Monitoring Strategies for MERN Applications

## Backend
- Use platform dashboards (Render, Railway, Heroku) for uptime and error monitoring.
- Optionally, set up UptimeRobot for external health checks.
- Add logging/alerting (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket).

## Frontend
- Use Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages dashboards for deploy status and errors.
- Optionally, use Sentry or LogRocket for frontend error monitoring.
